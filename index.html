              We specialize in targeted customizations and repairs for guitars and basses of all price points. We're not here to belittle your instrument and we're certainly not here to sell you one of ours.
              <br/><br/>
              We'll consult with you and help you customize your instrument to make it work specifically for <u>YOU</u>! Believe it or not, the quality, sound, and playability of your instrument and it's build has very little to do with what you paid for it.
              <br/><br/>
              In fact, the quality, sound, and playability of your instrument is more often affected by it's cost-to-build in the factory, allowing manufacturers to increase profit margins while convincing you that you're purchaing a better, higher quality instrument.
              <br/><br/>
              Contact us so that we can chat about your instrument, your technique, your musical style, and what it is you want to do with your instrument or how it is that you want your instrument to perform better.

                Our customizations are not for collectors, but rather for musicians. If your's is a collector's item of any kind, then you'd be better off leaving the instrument unmodified so that it may retain any monetary value that may be attributed to it.
              </div>
              <div class='title'>Cleaning</div>
              <div class='copytext'>
                A thorough cleaning of your instrument including a scrubbing of the fretboard, polishing of frets, tuners, bridges, and other hardware as well as a light polish and wax of the instrument's finished surfaces. We can even rebuild, polish, and regrease tuning machines and bridge components.
                <br/><br/>
                The cleaning service also includes a light oil treatment for unfinished necks, enhancing mobility or grip, per your preference, while keeping the fretboard from drying out. This also has the added benefit of significantly extending the life of the instrument's strings.

                includes a bridge adjustment and intonation for simple bridge mechanisms such as hardtail and <i>Tune-O-Matic</i> bridges as well as the one-way tremolos found on <i>Strats</i>.
                <br/><br/>
                This service <u>does not apply</u> to advanced tremolos such as <i>Floyd Rose</i> floating bridges as well as <i>AccuTune</i> and <i>Kahler</i> tremolos and other similar tremolos. These will require an Advanced Setup service.

              includes the same services performed with a <i>Basic Setup</i> but includes an adjustment to the neck's relief as well as the nut below the headstock to allow for a more precise <i>professional</i> setup across the length of the fretboard.
              <br/><br/>
              We can even reconfigure a four-string bass or six-string guitar to play like a five-string bass or seven-string guitar simply by omitting the string sets' first string and setting up the instrument accordingly.

              <br/><br/>
              We have a particular specialty in electronics. Let's chat and discuss the great many unique options available to customize your instrument for your musical style, physical technique, and amplifier configuration.

              <div class='copytext'>
                We can reshape your neck's profile, turning a <i>baseball bat</i> "U" shape, made for large hands, into a "V" shape for those <i>old-schoolers</i> who play with their thumb over the edge of the fretboard or a modern "C" shape, comfortable for most players and techniques.
                <br/><br/>
                We can also do compound neck profiles enhancing access to higher frets where chunky neck joints may otherwise be an obstruction. We can reshape clunky neck joints as well as perform calculated shims on bolt-on necks.
                <br/><br/>
                Do you have a "<i>hitchhiker's thumb</i>"; that is a <i>double-jointed thumb</i> that bends backwards at it's interphalangeal joint. We can reshape your neck with an asymmetrical "V" profile that moves the ridge slightly up towards the 5th or 6th strings, giving your thumb plenty of room to lay flat, reducing fatigue.
              </div>

              <div class='copytext'>
                We can perform a great number of customizations to guitar and bass bridges. This includes simple replacements, like high-mass bridges and steel, granite, or brass tremolo blocks as well as string-through-body modifications for hardtail bridges.
                <br/><br/>
                We can also properly block off <i>floored</i> trems; that is Strat trems tightened to sit flat against the body. This trick has also been known to work for unused floating bridges like some Floyd Rose Bridge models.
                <br/><br/>
                We can also shave down the wood base underneath your flat guitar or bass bridge, allowing for better control of string height where many stock bridges and saddles are simply too tall for their instrument.

              Besides cleaning and treating for better mobility or for better grip, per your preference. We can also perform custom and compound fretboard radius adjustments, refrets, and even partial or full fretboard scallops going as far up or down the neck as you wish.

                <br/><br/>
                We can perform repairs, adjustments, and replacements of acoustic and classical guitar and bass saddles and bridges.
                <br/><br/>
              We can also repair the guitar's soundboard, rebinding it as well as shaving down excessively thick soundboards and finishes that can cause your instrument to sound dull and flat.
                <br/><br/>
                Our expertise with electronics is not limited to electric instruments. We can install piezoelectric pickups or contact microphones in your bridge, saddle, or anywhere on your soundboard.
                <br/><br/>
                We can also retrofit preamp units, allowing for built-in equalizers or tuners. We can install a line-level balanced output, suitable for PA systems without the use of a direct box, or unbalanced outputs, allowing you to plug your guitar directly into any guitar amp's high impedence input.

                <br/><br/>
                We have a keen understanding of how quality may be potentially diminished by low-cost manufacturers. We specially select aftermarket hardware with our customers in mind, allowing for an acceptable level of quality where it actually matters and avoiding unnecessary <i>vanity features</i>.

                We are a group of active musicians who know our instruments and tools very well. We've all been around long enough to remember unhelpful local repair shops run by ornery old men with inflated egos (Anyone remember <i>Snukst Music</i> on South Pulaski Road, in Chicago?).
                <br/><br/>
                This service was founded because we've all argued with shop owners, knowing that the work to be performed would not be taken seriously simply because a shop owner had very specific opinions about instruments not made in the USA or otherwise of a particular vintage.
                <br/><br/>
                Many brands, over the years, have cut quality while raising prices (anyone remember those original Made-In-Mexico Strats? How about when a Gibson USA Explorer or a Fender USA Jaguar cost $400). No guitar sold today will ever be a collector's item or a <i>nest egg</i>, simply because they're not built to be so. We're here to service real musicians' instruments, not some collector's eye candy. We <i>want</i> you to keep that old instrument, custominzing it to fit your evolving technique and style without <i>breaking the bank</i> on expensive customizations or a brand new instrument of dubious quality.

Sal actively absorbed knowledge from a vast array of available literature and a burgeoning <i>World Wide Web</i>.
